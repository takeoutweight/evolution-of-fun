# The Evolution of Fun
## A Generic Model of Video Game Challenge for Automatic Level Design

This is an assortment of code that supported a good deal of my master's research from 2008-2010. I combined genetic algorithms with constraint satisfaction to test a model for identifying fun video game levels fun. This model was based on the notion of "Rhythm Groups:" periodic configurations of difficult sections followed by easier sections.

Note that this is "research code." It wasn't intended to serve as a slick, well documented library. Much of it is rather old: some of it pre-dates the Clojure 1.0 release!

## Getting Started

You need [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/).

You will also need the JaCoP 3.2 constraint satisfaction library. You can download the [jar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jacop-solver/). It isn't available on any Maven repositories, but can be installed locally so Leiningen can find it via
`mvn install:install-file "-Dfile=JaCoP-3.2.jar" "-DgroupId=JaCoP" "-DartifactId=JaCoP" "-Dversion=3.2" "-Dpackaging=jar" "-DgeneratePom=true"` (thanks to [this blog post](http://xfthhxk.blogspot.ca/2013/05/maven-mayhem.html)).

There is a mixture of Clojure and Java code, so the project needs to be compiled in stages:

`lein with-profile precomp javac`
`lein compile`
`lein with-profile postcomp javac`

To try some auto-generated levels, start a repl: `lein repl` and load the program via `(require '[nathansorenson.level-evolve :as le])` and start evolving with `(le/start)`.

After a few minutes, you can `(le/run-best)` to play the current highest-fitness  level.
